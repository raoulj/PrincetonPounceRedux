# PrincetonPounceRedux

After I didn't get into a course I wanted, and discovered (Pounce)[https://pounce.tigerapps.org/] to be non-functional, I slapped this together: a quick and dirty Twilio-based Princeton enrollment-opening notification service.

Using a trial Twilio account (which is easily created and set up), all one would have to do is update the corresponding token, SSID, and service phone #, to send text messages to yourself if a course were to open.
